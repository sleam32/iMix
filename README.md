NSS-iMix
====

Final NSS Capstone-A Rails application to be used by bartenders as a way of letting patrons create their own cocktails. Initially this will be a Rails-based web app, but I would like to turn it into an iPad application in the future.

Purpose
============
To provide better customer service for those guests who are unsure of what they want to order at the bar.


Project Status/TODO
========================
All of the main features are working. There are a few glitches that should be addressed:

1. The "new recipes" page needs to be redesigned entirely.
2. Eliminate the 1 giant drop down, and create multiple drop downs that are more specific and categorized.
3. The ingredients still don't list out upon search of a user's name.

Upcoming Features
=============

Multiple drop downs
Ratings Feature

Usage Instructions
======================
Enter your name, state and choose a nickname for the drink you want to create.
Choose your ingredients from the dropdown, click save and enjoy. 
In the future, you will be able to give a rating of the drink you made, in order to keep a record of how much you like a particular set of ingredients mixed together.

Demo
==============
Download and enjoy!
